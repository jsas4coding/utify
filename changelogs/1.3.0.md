## [1.3.0] - 2025-03-23

### Added

- Implemented full support for `Get*` and `Get*f` functions that return `(string, error)` for all message types.
- Added tests for `Get*` and `Get*f` variants to ensure correct error handling and output.
- Added `TestSetColorTableOverride` to verify custom ANSI color overrides.
- Added `TestLogOutput` to validate structured logging with message type tags (e.g., `[ERROR]`, `[INFO]`).

### Changed

- Split message function tests to differentiate between return (`Get*`) and no-return (`Success`, `Error`, etc.) implementations.
- Refactored test definitions for proper function signatures and removed invalid error assertions from no-return message methods.
- Improved test clarity and naming consistency across all test cases.
