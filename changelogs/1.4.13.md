# [1.4.13] - 2025-07-31

### ðŸ“š Documentation

- **Changelog Restructure:**
  - Split the monolithic `CHANGELOG.md` into individual files under `changelogs/`, one per version.
  - Updated the main `CHANGELOG.md` to serve as an index linking to each version.
  - Added a short project description at the top of the main changelog for better context.

### ðŸ›  CI/CD

- **Release Workflow Update:**
  - Release body now pulls from the dedicated version changelog file (`changelogs/{version}.md`).
  - Workflow now fails if the changelog file for the tagged version does not exist or is missing from the index.
  - Added coverage enforcement: pipeline fails if total coverage drops below **90%**.
  - Generated a Markdown-formatted coverage report as a build artifact.
