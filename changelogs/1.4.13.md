# [1.4.13] - 2025-07-31

### ðŸ“š Documentation

- **Changelog Restructure:**
  - Split the monolithic `CHANGELOG.md` into individual files under `changelogs/`, one per version.
  - Updated the main `CHANGELOG.md` to serve as an index linking to each version.
  - Added a short project description at the top of the main changelog for better context.

### ðŸ›  CI/CD

- **Release Workflow Update:**
  - Release body now pulls from the dedicated version changelog file (`changelogs/{version}.md`).
  - Workflow now fails if the changelog file for the tagged version does not exist or is missing from the index.
  - Added coverage enforcement: pipeline fails if total coverage drops below **90%**.
  - Generated a Markdown-formatted coverage report as a build artifact.

### ðŸ§ª Testing

- **Test Structure Improvements:**
  - Restructured unit tests to be located in their corresponding package directories.
  - Moved tests from `tests/unit/` to respective package directories (e.g., `pkg/colors/colors_test.go`).
  - Updated test coverage configuration to use atomic mode and exclude example files.
  - Introduced more robust coverage tracking mechanism
  - Current focus areas for test improvement:
    - Enhance edge case testing in logging and icon detection
    - Expand integration test scenarios
    - Add performance and concurrency tests

### ðŸ”§ Project Structure

- **Repository Organization:**
  - Updated Makefile to exclude examples directory from test coverage.
  - Adjusted test configuration to run tests from `tests/`, `pkg/`, and `internal/` directories.
  - Added `.gitignore` configuration for better repository management.

### ðŸ”¬ Code Quality

- **Continuous Improvement:**
  - Refined error handling and test coverage.
  - Improved icon and logging functionality test cases.
  - Enhanced package-level test suites to provide more robust code verification.
