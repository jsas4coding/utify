## [1.4.2] - 2025-07-27

### ‚ö° Performance & Code Quality

- **Code Refactoring**: Reduced cyclomatic complexity for better maintainability
  - Refactored `detectNerdFont()` function: Split complex logic into 4 focused functions
  - Refactored `Echo()` function: Split formatting logic into 6 specialized functions
  - All functions now have complexity ‚â§ 9 (under threshold of 10)

### üîß CI/CD Improvements

- **Enhanced Workflow Configuration**: Improved GitHub Actions setup
  - **Go Version Management**: All workflows now read Go version from `go.mod` file
  - **Smart CI Triggering**: Optimized to avoid duplicate runs while ensuring comprehensive coverage
    - Runs on: pull requests to main, pushes to main, and tag pushes (releases)
    - Codecov uploads on main branch updates and releases
  - **Updated Codecov Integration**: Upgraded to `codecov/codecov-action@v5` with better error handling
  - **Removed Problematic Dependencies**: Fixed security scanning by removing non-existent packages

### üèóÔ∏è Code Organization

- **Better Separation of Concerns**: Functions now follow single responsibility principle
- **Improved Readability**: Complex logic broken down into smaller, focused functions
- **Enhanced Maintainability**: Changes can be made to specific functionality without affecting others

### üß™ Quality Assurance

- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: All functions now pass complexity analysis (gocyclo -over 10)
- **Static Analysis**: Clean staticcheck results
- **Comprehensive Testing**: All unit and integration tests continue to pass
- **Lint Compliance**: Maintains 0 lint issues across all linters.
