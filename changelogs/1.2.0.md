## [1.2.0] - 2025-03-22

### Added

- All message methods (`Success`, `Error`, `Info`, etc.) now return `(string, error)`.
- Introduced `ErrSilent` as a sentinel error for already displayed errors.
- Added fluent option methods for `Options` (e.g., `WithBold`, `WithoutColor`).
- Extended `Echo` to support `Callback` execution or `Exit`, depending on configuration.
- Full test coverage for all message types and formatting combinations.
- Added formatted versions of all message functions (e.g., `Successf`, `Errorf`, etc.).

### Changed

- `Echo` now accepts `*Options` instead of `Options` value.
- `Callback` and `Exit` are now mutually exclusive.
- Improved ANSI handling and color application.

### Fixed

- Fixed handling of `os.Stdout` and `ReadFrom` in test utilities.
- Fixed styling override conflicts between `NoStyle`, `Bold`, and `Italic`.
