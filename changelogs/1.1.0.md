## [1.1.0] - 2025-03-15

### Added

- Introduced `OptionsDefault()` for easier initialization of options.
- Added support for `WithExit()` and `WithCallback()` ensuring mutual exclusivity:
  - If `Callback` is set, `Exit` is automatically disabled.
  - If `Exit` is enabled, `Callback` is removed.
- Implemented **table-driven tests** covering all functionalities.
- Added **log output** for each message type (`Success`, `Error`, `Warning`, etc.).

### Changed

- Improved `Echo()` function to respect `NoColor`, `NoStyle`, and `NoIcon` options correctly.
- Refactored `WithExit()` and `WithCallback()` to properly enforce behavior.
- Enhanced documentation and README to reflect new changes.

### Fixed

- Fixed issue where `Exit` and `Callback` could be set simultaneously.
- Resolved linter error (`errcheck`) by handling the return value of `buf.ReadFrom()` in tests.
- Improved test reliability and robustness.
